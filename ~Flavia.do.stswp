/* Question a. 
******************************************************************************
Because divorce rates are group averages for each state, we want to account for how many observations (individuals) were used to compute it. According to the weighting procedures summary, we should use analytic weights, weighting according to stpop.
We use analytic weights when working with group-mean observations, this ensures that results are representative and it allows to give relatively more weight to the averages computed on larger samples, which would result in more precise estimates of divorce rates.

/* Do your results support the assumption of parallel trends? 
The first graph compares states that reformed in 1968 and 1988 and those that did not. We see that before the wave of reform, both samples seem to follow the same upward trend, supporting the parallel trends assumption. 
The second graph compares states that adopted the unilateral divorce law between 69 and 73 to the late reform states, that adopted it in 2000. Again, the trend in divorce rates seems to be the same across the control and reform states, supporting the parallel trends assumption.

/* The coefficients between regression i and ii have significant differences. In the pooled OLS, the estimate for post_unilateral is significantly greater than 0, suggesting that the introduction of the unilateral law has a positive effect on divorce rates. However, when we include the variable unilateral, accounting for state fixed effects, the estimate for post_unilateral reduces to -.0050148, and becomes insignificant (p-value=0.993). The difference-in-difference accounts for pre-existing differences in divorce rates between states whereas the pooled OLS estimates the difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups in 1978 (the post year). This positive bias comes from selection of states in the treatment group, as states adopting the law generally faced higher divorce rates. */

/* The first regression controls for state and year differences yiels an estimate of -.055 suggesting that the introduction of unilateral laws decreased divorce rates by .055â€° but the result is very insignificant (p-value = .718). There is no clear evidence that unilateral divorce law had an effect on divorce rates in this regression.
The second regression adds state-specific linear time trends to regression i. The estimate for IMP_UNILATERAL goes up to 0.477, and the coefficient is statistically significant at the 5%. So once we control for linear time trends the regression finds a significant increase of 0.477 divorces per 1000 people after the unilateral divorce law was implemented. 
The third regression controls for both state-specific linear and quadratic time trends (in addition to state and year fixed effects). Here, the coefficient for unilateral is 0.33 and is also statistically significant.

Because the initial regression returns such different coefficients than the second/third regression, it points to potential omitted variable bias in the first regression. If there are unobserved state specific time trends in divorce rates that are correlated with the timing of divorce law reforms, omitting them will bias the estimated effect of unilateral divorce laws. Friedberg argues that these trends may reflect social and demographic shifts.

The estimates would be the same if the parallel trends assumption held perfectly, as the divorce time trends would be identical across reformed and control states.
